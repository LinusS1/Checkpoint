# Checkpoint
Proofread your emails before your boss does

🧠 Have you ever meant to reread an email before sending it but then forgot and just sent it anyways?

🍗 Now with Checkpoint you don’t have to worry about it!

🎄 Checkpoint is an extension for Apple Mail that reminds you to reread your emails. Just click a button (or check a box to do it for all emails) and you’ll be on your way!

🚨 Mail started supporting official extensions with macOS Monterey meaning this does not inject stuff into mail and is officially supported!

👁 The code is pretty messy, it’ll be cleaned up _“in the future”_
